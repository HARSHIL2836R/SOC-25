# LLM-Powered Research Agent

Welcome to the LLM-Powered Research Agent project! This repository is designed to help you explore and build intelligent systems using large language models (LLMs). Over the past few weeks, I've delved into key concepts like text splitting, chunking, embeddings, and prompting, along with leveraging the powerful LangChain API.

Resources are on the [Notion page](https://responsible-minibus-af3.notion.site/LLM-Powered-Research-Agent-SOC-1fa6bc81b71780fab5f8d992834af017).

Over the past four weeks, I have immersed myself in the intricacies of text processing and the LangChain API, gaining a comprehensive understanding of working with large language models (LLMs). Through a combination of YouTube tutorials and practical experimentation, I explored essential techniques such as text splitting and chunking. Leveraging tools like the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, I fine-tuned chunk sizes and overlaps to efficiently process large documents. This approach enabled the creation of structured document chunks, optimized for downstream tasks like embeddings and vector-based searches.

Furthermore, I delved into the LangChain API's advanced capabilities for embedding generation and vector storage. By utilizing models such as `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, I transformed textual data into high-dimensional vector representations, which were then stored in vector databases like FAISS for efficient similarity searches. I also experimented with LangChain's dynamic prompting features, crafting context-aware templates to interact effectively with LLMs. These experiences have equipped me with the technical expertise to design intelligent systems capable of processing, analyzing, and interacting with text data. The structured framework provided by the Notion page on the LLM-Powered Research Agent further solidified these learnings, offering practical insights for real-world applications.

## Text Splitters

Text splitters are tools used to break down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks for efficient processing. Different types of text splitters are available, each suited for specific use cases:

- **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter**: This splitter recursively breaks text into smaller chunks based on character limits, ensuring that chunks are neither too large nor too small. It is highly effective for processing research papers as it maintains logical coherence within sections.
- **TokenTextSplitter**: Splits text based on token limits, which is particularly useful when working with models that have token-based input constraints.
- **SentenceTextSplitter**: Splits text into individual sentences, making it ideal for tasks requiring sentence-level granularity, such as summarization or sentiment analysis.
- **Custom Splitters**: These can be tailored to specific needs, such as splitting by paragraphs, sections, or custom delimiters.

### Best Practices for Research Papers

- Used the **RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter** for research papers as it ensures that sections like abstracts, introductions, and conclusions remain intact, preserving the logical flow of information.
- Configured chunk sizes and overlaps to balance between context retention and processing efficiency. For example, a chunk size of 1000 characters with a 200-character overlap works well for most research papers.

These techniques ensure that the text is optimally prepared for downstream tasks like embeddings, similarity searches, or summarization.

## LangChain API

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). Key features include:

- **Prompt Templates**: LangChain provides tools to create reusable and dynamic prompt templates, allowing developers to craft context-aware queries for LLMs.
- **Chains**: Chains are sequences of operations that combine multiple components, such as prompts, embeddings, and vector searches, to build complex workflows.
- **Embeddings**: LangChain supports embedding generation using models like `HuggingFaceEmbeddings`, enabling the transformation of text into high-dimensional vectors for similarity searches and clustering.
- **Vector Stores**: Integration with vector databases like FAISS allows for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, making it easier to perform tasks like document retrieval and question answering.
- **Memory**: LangChain includes memory modules to maintain conversational context, enabling applications to handle multi-turn interactions effectively.
- **Toolkits**: LangChain provides pre-built tools and integrations for tasks like web scraping, API calls, and more, streamlining the development process.

These features make LangChain a versatile and powerful framework for building intelligent systems that leverage the capabilities of LLMs.
